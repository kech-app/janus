Understood! I'll provide a comprehensive example of the `Demo.HR.Employee` resource file with an extensive set of fields and attributes. Each field will be configured with the mentioned properties (Invisible, Required, Read-only, Label, Help Tooltip, Placeholder, Widget, and Limit visibility to groups) and attributes will be kept separate from fields.

### Extensive Resource File: `Demo.HR.Employee`

```elixir
defmodule Demo.HR.Employee do
  use Ash.Resource,
    data_layer: AshPostgres.DataLayer,
    authorizers: [Ash.Policy.Authorizer],
    extensions: [AshAdmin.Resource]

  postgres do
    table "employees"
    repo Demo.Repo
  end

  # Attributes Section
  attributes do

    field :emergency_contact, :text_input, label: "Emergency Contact", invisible: true, read_only: true, limit_visibility_to_groups: [:admin, :hr_manager], help_tooltip: "Emergency contact details", placeholder: "Jane Doe: +1 234 567 891"
    field :birthday, :date_picker, label: "Birthday"
  end

  # Calculations, Relationships, Actions, and Widgets as defined earlier
  # ...

end
```

### Explanation:

- **Attributes Section**: Includes all attributes for the `Employee` entity. Attributes like `emergency_contact` are marked as required.
- **Fields Section**: Each field has specific UI properties like label, placeholder, and visibility settings. For instance, `emergency_contact` is configured to be invisible and read-only, with visibility limited to certain user groups.
- **Widget Customization**: Widgets are assigned to each field to define the UI interaction. For example, `salary` uses a currency input widget, while `skills` use a tag editor.

This example showcases a robust and feature-rich resource definition, capturing the complexity and flexibility of systems like Odoo. It demonstrates how Janus can be utilized to handle a diverse range of data types and user interface requirements in a comprehensive and organized manner.
